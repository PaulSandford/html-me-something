                <p>My coding story started when I began to play games on my computer. I learned about various inputs that
                    influenced the game like a command line would. I began to experiment with combinations of messages for new results.
                    Then I learned about Macros. These are like coding lines that follow the game's syntax. Now I'm at a point where I
                    want more control over what I can tell a computer to do. </p>

                    I went to ITT Technical University and reached my associates in software development. Due to the closure
                    of the school and the aftermath, I took time to get myself to come back to studying programming.
